Cmdlets in PowerShell
--------------------------
Small, single-purpose commands used in PowerShell to perform specific tasks.
They are the building blocks of PowerShell.

They always follws the below pattern
Verb-noun

Verb → action (Get, Set, New, Remove, Start, Stop)
Noun → object (Process, Service, User, File, EventLog)

Examples:
Get-Process
Get-Service
Start-Service
Stop-Process
Get-EventLog


Cmdlets with Pipeline
---------------------------
Cmdlets shine when combined using | (pipe):

ex:
Get-Process | Where-Object CPU -gt 2





Parameters in PowerShell (PS)

Parameters are options or inputs you pass to a cmdlet to control its behavior or output.
They usually start with a dash (-).

Syntax: Cmdlet-Name -ParameterName Value

Get-Process -Name chrome
Get-Process -Name chrome -FileVersionInfo
